# PRODIGY_DS_01
This repository contains a Python script that creates a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, using a sample dataset from the World Bank. The goal is to demonstrate how to plot the distribution of a specific variable (e.g., population) for a country or region over a period of time.

**Sample Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the World Bank and can be accessed [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL). It contains data on the total population of various countries from different years.

**Objective**
The primary objective of this project is to:
Fetch the dataset from the World Bank API.
Analyze the population distribution using a bar chart or histogram.
Visualize trends over the years or between different countries based on the chosen variables (e.g., total population).

**Installation**

To run this project locally, ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher). Then, install the necessary dependencies by running:


pip install -r requirements.txt

**Dependencies**
This project relies on the following libraries:
pandas - For data manipulation and processing.
matplotlib - For creating visualizations (e.g., bar charts or histograms).
requests - For fetching the dataset from the World Bank API.

To install them manually, use the following commands:

pip install pandas matplotlib requests


**Script Explanation**

plot_population.py: This script fetches population data from the World Bank, processes it, and generates a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution.
The data is fetched using the requests library.
The data is then loaded into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.
Depending on the userâ€™s choice, a bar chart or histogram is created using matplotlib.

**Sample Output**

The script will generate a plot, such as the one below:

A bar chart showing the total population of various countries for a specific year.
A histogram showing the distribution of total population for a specific region or country over multiple years.

**Customizations**

You can easily modify the script to:
Display different countries or regions.
Change the variable (e.g., to show GDP or life expectancy).
Adjust the plot style (e.g., colors, labels, etc.).
